      <p>I am a freshman that is part of the Class of 2022. This will be my first year in CSULB and I've decided to put my heart into it. I am Asian American, specifically Taiwanese American, and I grew up in Rowland Heights. This website will be mostly about what I have been up to and things I have faced in my journey. There really isn't that much to talk about myself. I live in Rowland Heights and I went to Rowland High School. I am single and ready to mingle. I love to play PC games and browse the web. If you have any song recommendations I am all ears. I will be posting projects that I have created or participated in. Please stay tuned for more information! Thanks!</p>
